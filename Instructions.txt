Good evening, This project has 2 parts:
The laravel part is: test-app
The vuejs part is: vue-project

The project does not have a login form nor a sign up form
Once you forlk the project from git hub serve both the laravel
and the vue js part

To get the data for the user perform a db seed in the laravel section
The line of code for seeding the user relation has been provided and 
it creates 10 new records

Warm regards,
Wilson Onjore,
